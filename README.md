# ElasticExplorer

## What is this
Nothing yet, but I'm working on building out an NW (node-webkit) application for exploring Elasticsearch data.  The core is going to be React+Flux.

### Running & Building

*  `npm start` - watch file for changes & rebuild
*  `npm test` - run mocha all tests in `test/`
*  `npm run app` - run node-webkit app
*  `npm run build` - Build the app as an executable for the current platform
